Journey Lite Weight Loss Metrics (Version 1.0 / 2/11/2023)

This Java code is a patient metric calculator, where users can input their height, weight, age, and gender to receive a summary of their results. The code first creates a Scanner object to read inputs from the user and then displays a welcome message. The user inputs their height, weight, and age, with the code checking that each value is greater than 0. The user then inputs their gender as either 'M' or 'F'. The code calculates the patient's starting Body Mass Index (BMI), today's BMI, ideal weight, and a variety of other metrics including BEE (Basal Energy Expenditure), fluid goal, excess weight loss percentage, protein goal, and others. The code also determines whether the patient has lost or gained weight and displays the results in a console output. The code rounds off some of the results to a single decimal place and provides a brief interpretation of the patient's BMI results.
